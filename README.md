# ANN-Classification-Churn

## Overview

This project focuses on building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for customer churn classification and deploying the model using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface. Customer churn prediction is a vital task for businesses to identify and retain at-risk customers by analyzing their demographic and behavioral data.

## Live Demo

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
- **Modeling:** Implementation of an ANN using TensorFlow/Keras for binary classification.
- **Web App:** Streamlit-based interface for real-time predictions.
- **Deployment Ready:** Easily deployable Streamlit application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harsha-chichu/ANN-Classification-Churn.git
   cd ANN-Classification-Churn
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit application:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Access the web interface:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with the deployed model.

## Model Architecture

The ANN model consists of:

- **Input Layer:** Accepts the preprocessed features.
- **Hidden Layers:** Two dense layers with ReLU activation functions.
- **Output Layer:** A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.
